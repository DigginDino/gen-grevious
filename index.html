<h2>Rebels</h2>
<p>It has come to my attention that some citizens of the empire have begun to rebel against our empire. I would like to remind all limperial citizens that under the empire, you have safety, freedom, and security. Without the empire, you and many many others are nothing. Do not attempt to rebel or take part in these acts of terror against the empire. Or a stormtrooper legion will see to it that justice is administered.</p>
